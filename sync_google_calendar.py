"""Sync upcoming events from a public Google Calendar into
data/community_events.yaml.

Reads the calendar's ICS feed from the GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ICS_URL environment
variable, converts each event into this repo's event schema, and writes the
result to data/community_events.yaml. Google Calendar is the only source of
events: the file is replaced on every sync, so anything added by hand is
removed.

If GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ICS_URL isn't set yet, this exits without changing
anything, so the scheduled workflow can run safely before the calendar URL
is configured.
