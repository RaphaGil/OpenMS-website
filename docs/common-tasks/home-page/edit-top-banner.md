| Number | Line(s) | What it is |
|:--:|---------|-----------|
| 1 | `eyebrow:` | The small label above the headline. |
| 2 | `titleBefore:`, `titleMid:`, `titleHighlight:`, `titleAfter:` | The headline, in four pieces joined together. `titleHighlight` is shown in a different colour. |
| 3 | `description:` | The paragraph under the headline. Several lines are fine. Keep them indented. |
| 4 | `buttontext:` and `buttonlink:` | The first button: its **words** and **where it goes**. |
| 5 | `secondaryButtonText:` and `secondaryButtonLink:` | The second (outlined) button. |
| 6 | `trustNote:` | The three short phrases under the buttons, separated by `·`. |
