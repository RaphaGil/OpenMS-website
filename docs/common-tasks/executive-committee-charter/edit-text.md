# Change the text of the Executive Committee Charter page

The page **https://openms.de/exec_committee/** (footer → **COMMUNITY**) has **all its words in one page file**: `content/en/exec_committee.md`.

**You will change:** a few words in one file  ·  **Time:** about 10 minutes  ·  **Skills needed:** none

**On the website**

![The Executive Committee Charter page with title, heading and text numbered](../../common-tasks-screenshot-images/executive-committee-charter/1-page.png)

**In the page file**

![The beginning of exec_committee.md with matching numbers](../../common-tasks-screenshot-images/executive-committee-charter/2-page-file.png)

The numbers match: the part marked **1** on the website is the line marked **1** in the file.

## What you will change

| In the file | On the page |
|---|---|
| `title:` between the two `---` lines | The big title. |
| A line starting with `## ` | A section heading. |
| A normal line | A paragraph of text. |

## Step by step

1. Open **https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS-website/blob/main/content/en/exec_committee.md** and click the **pencil icon**. ([Need help?](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#step-1--open-the-file))
2. Find your sentence (**Ctrl + F** on Windows or **Cmd + F** on Mac, after clicking inside the text box).
3. Change the words, like in a Word document.
4. Save and send for review: [How to make a change, steps 3 to 6](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#step-3--save-commit-changes).
5. Open the **Deploy Preview** and check **/exec_committee/**.

## Do not touch

- The top block between the two lines of `---` (except the `title:` if you want a new title).
- Lines that start with `{{<`. They are special building blocks. Ask the web team.
