# OpenMS Web Apps page: Change the blocks

The page **https://openms.de/webapps/** (top menu → **Projects** → **OpenMS Web Apps**) is made of blocks, one under the other. Most of its words are in `config.yaml`.

**You will change:** a few lines in `config.yaml`  ·  **Time:** about 10 minutes  ·  **Skills needed:** none

**On the website**

**In `config.yaml`**

The numbers match: the part marked **1** on the website is the line marked **1** in the file.

## What you will change

| Block on the page | Search for | Lines you can change |
|---|---|---|
| Turn a Jupyter notebook into a web app (the navy block under the big title) | `webappsPage` → `notebook` | `eyebrow` (small label), `title`, `lead`, the `prompt` people copy, `note`, the numbered `steps` (each has `title` and `text`), and `buttons` (each has `text` and `url`). Any number of steps and buttons works. The first button is blue, the others outlined. |
| Highlights | `webappsPage` → `highlights` | `items`: each box has `title` and `text` |
| Need help? | `webappsPage` → `usingTemplate` | The "Need help?" box under `items`: its `title`, `text` and `links` (the buttons). There is no "Get started" band any more. Adding a `title:` line, or a card with a `url`, brings that dark band back above the box. |
| Examples | `webappsPage` → `examples` | the example apps shown |
| For developers, and the citation | `webappsPage` → `developers` | `title`, `lead`, `citeText`, the paper under `citation`, and the cards under `boxes`. Any number of boxes works: the usual numbers have their own layout, others sit in equal columns (3 or 4 per row on a laptop, 1 on a phone). A box with `type: links` shows its `platforms` as blue links in a row, like on OpenMS-lib. |

The **big title at the top** is part of the design (`layouts/partials/webapps-hero.html`). To change it, ask the web team ([Who to ask](../../workflow/who-to-ask.md)).

In each block, change the words after `title:`, `lead:`, `text:` and similar lines. Leave lines like `layout:`, `icon:`, `accent:`, `featured:` or `group:` as they are: they set how the block looks.

The **Copy prompt** button copies exactly the words after `prompt:`. Write the prompt as one paragraph: line breaks in `config.yaml` become spaces.

To put a **link inside a step's text**, write the words in square brackets and the web address in round brackets right after, with no space: `[Docker Compose](https://github.com/OpenMS/streamlit-deployment)`. Links to other websites open in a new tab.

To **add a card**, copy a whole card (from its `- title:` line to the line before the next `- title:`), paste it under the last one and change the words. To **remove a card**, delete all its lines.

## Step by step

1. Open **https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS-website/blob/main/config.yaml** and click the **pencil icon**. ([Need help?](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#step-1--open-the-file))
2. Click inside the text box, press **Ctrl + F** (Windows) or **Cmd + F** (Mac) and search for `webappsPage`.
3. Change **only the words after the colon**. Keep the quotes and the spaces at the start of each line. See [Spaces matter](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#spaces-matter-in-configyaml).
4. Save and send for review: [How to make a change, steps 3 to 6](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#step-3--save-commit-changes).
5. Open the **Deploy Preview** and check **/webapps/**.
