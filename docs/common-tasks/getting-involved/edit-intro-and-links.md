# Change the intro and links of the Getting Involved page

The page **Getting Involved** has the address **https://openms.de/contribute/** (the address and the menu label are different).

**You will change:** a few lines in `config.yaml` (search for `contributePage:`)  ·  **Time:** about 10 minutes  ·  **Skills needed:** none

**On the website**

**In `config.yaml`**

![The contributePage lines in config.yaml, numbered](../../common-tasks-screenshot-images/getting-involved/2-config.png)

The numbers match: the part marked **1** on the website is the line marked **1** in the file. Lines **3** to **5** are addresses used by the buttons and links further down the page.

## What you will change

| Part of the page | Lines in `contributePage` |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| The small word above the title | `eyebrow` |
| The intro sentence | `subtitle` |
| The links used on the page (Discord, GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues, Governance, the website repository…) | `links`: change the address after each name |
| The social links (Discord, LinkedIn, X, Bluesky) | `social` |
| The community e-mail address | `communityEmail` |

The **headings and texts** of the page ("Ways to contribute", "Contribute to development", "Stay in touch"…) are part of the design. To change them, ask the web team ([Who to ask](../../workflow/who-to-ask.md)).
