# Change the intro text of the Scientific and Technical Support page

The page **https://openms.de/scientific-and-technical-support/** (top menu → **Services**) starts with a small word above the title and an intro sentence. These are in `config.yaml`.

**You will change:** one or two lines in `config.yaml`  ·  **Time:** about 5 minutes  ·  **Skills needed:** none

**On the website**

**In `config.yaml`**

![The servicesSupportPage lines in config.yaml with matching numbers](../../common-tasks-screenshot-images/scientific-and-technical-support/2-config.png)

The numbers match: the part marked **1** on the website is the line marked **1** in the file.

## What you will change

| Part of the page | Line in `servicesSupportPage` |
|---|---|
| The small word above the title | `eyebrow` |
| The intro sentence | `subtitle` |
| The heading above the form ("Get in touch with us for a quote.") | `formTitle` |

The other words (the big title and all other texts) are part of the design (`layouts/partials/scientific-and-technical-support-main.html`). To change them, ask the web team ([Who to ask](../../workflow/who-to-ask.md)).

## Step by step

1. Open **https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS-website/blob/main/config.yaml** and click the **pencil icon**. ([Need help?](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#step-1--open-the-file))
2. Click inside the text box, press **Ctrl + F** (Windows) or **Cmd + F** (Mac) and search for `servicesSupportPage:`.
3. Change **only the words after the colon**. Keep the quotes and the spaces at the start of each line. See [Spaces matter](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#spaces-matter-in-configyaml).
4. Save and send for review: [How to make a change, steps 3 to 6](../../getting-started/edit-via-github.md#step-3--save-commit-changes).
5. Open the **Deploy Preview** and check **/scientific-and-technical-support/**.
