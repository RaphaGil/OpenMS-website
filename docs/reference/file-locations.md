# File locations — quick lookup

“I want to change X” → edit Y.

## Everything in the navbar and the footer: where is each page?

Every link in the **top menu** and the **footer** is listed here, with the files behind it. Paths are shortened:

- **Page file** = `content/en/…` (the page's own file and title; also its words when the page says "page file" under *Words*).
- **Design** = `layouts/partials/…` (the template that arranges the page). Ask the web team before changing these.
- **Words** = where the visible text is written: the page file, a key in `config.yaml`, or the layout.
- **Styling** = `assets/css/…` (colours, spacing). Page adjustments are in `assets/css/overrides/`.

The routing rule: `layouts/_default/single.html` looks at the page's file name and picks its `…-main.html` design.

### The navbar (top menu)

The menu itself (labels, order, links) is **`config.yaml` → `navbar`**. Its design is `layouts/partials/navbar*.html`, its behaviour is `assets/js/navbar.js`, and its styling is `assets/css/navbar-*.css` and `overrides/navbar-footer.css`. The logo is `config.yaml` → `navbarlogo`. The search box is `config.yaml` → `navbarSearch`, `layouts/partials/navbar-search.html` and `assets/js/navbar-search.js`.

### The footer

The footer's columns, links and social icons are **`config.yaml` → `footer`** (see [Change the footer links](../common-tasks/footer/edit-footer-links.md)). Its design is `layouts/partials/footer.html`, and its styling is `overrides/navbar-footer.css`. The copyright line is written in `footer.html`. Its year is set by a small script from the visitor's clock, so it changes by itself on 1 January (the year of the last build is shown when JavaScript is off).

| Column | Link | Address | Page file | Design | Words | Styling |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|---------|

**Example: where is the "Getting Involved" page?**

- Its address is `/contribute/` (the menu label and the address differ).
- The page file is `content/en/contribute.md` (only the title and a few settings).
- The design is `layouts/partials/contribute-main.html`.
- The intro text and links are in `config.yaml` under `contributePage`.
- The look is in `assets/css/overrides/contribute.css`.

Pages **not** in the menu or footer: `/404` (the error page), `/core_developers/` (linked from Governance), and `/help/` (linked from Contact). The unused pages `/help-request/`, `/jobs/`, `/getting-started/develop-your-own-openms-tools/` and `/keyfeatures/…` are removed by PR #51; their addresses redirect to other pages. Folders and pictures the site does not use are listed in [Archive folders](archive-folders.md). The home page is `layouts/index.html` with its text in `config.yaml` (see [Edit the home page](../common-tasks/home-page/README.md)).
